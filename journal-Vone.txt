Today's corporate world is growing with the speed of light, everything in our corporate world is getting automated to boost the industry but the way of taking
attendance or tracking a record of people's presence is still ancient way. Educational institutes still use the old method of calling out the name of a roll of
students. We can say that companies, educational institutes and governmental offices around the world still use some of the old methods like managing attendance
sheets. However nowadays in the fast-paced working environment, these old methods are too inconvenient and inefficient.  The method of taking attendance records
has evolved through the years but still, they can't completely fix the problems like:

1) A Biometric system using fingerprints is the most common way of taking attendance that is used by companies to ensure that employees are truly present 
by scanning their fingerprints or handprint. But we all know after 2020 it is not a good idea to use a public fingerprint sensor.

2) Scanning the QR code on the ID card, also takes time and is not that convenient.


In the corporate world, Employee attendance affects the overtime pay, your customer's experience and your overall finances. In the Educational field,
it affects the whole progress of the students.
Challenges to attendance include unexpected absences, late arrivals, early departures and sick employees coming to work.
We should craft attendance policies and use time and attendance software to measure employeesâ€™ hours.
The modern way we want to implement is to fix a sensor which keeps a track of who is present at that particular point. How is this different from CCTV,
CCTV camera just records the activity and stores it in the server, our sensor records the activity, analysis the data that it receives, recognizes the face,
calculates the activity and stores the whole summary of what exactly was happening at that point. In simple words we can say a CCTV camera is like an eye
and our sensor is like an eye with a brain.
